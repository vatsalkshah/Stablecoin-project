ERC-20 token modified to add the dividend functionality

## Why?
Developed for rMine to issue dividends to its investors.

## How does it work?
This is an ERC20 token that has additional functionality allowing token owners to redeem a share of the token contract's balance (in Ether) in the form of a dividend. Users that own more of the token can redeem greater shares of the contract's balance than those who own less of the token.
